* [Stack Overflow](https://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line)
* [Blog post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-console-a-terminal-and-a-shell)

So here are some commonly used shell for windows

* `cmd` (defaut one) and `command.com` many hate these

And here is a list of `terminal`'s you can use

* `conhost` garbage 🗑 terminal and the default one
* `Windows Terminal` 🌟 open source windows terminal
* `Hyper` electron based
* `ConEmu`
